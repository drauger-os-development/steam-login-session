Description: Launch Steam Big Picture from your login screen
 Log straight into Steam Big Picture mode from your login page. Based off of steam-session by Thomaz Reis at https://github.com/thor27/steam-login/
 .
 With the release of Steam Beta, and Steam Big Picture mode on Linux, this package will put Steam as a login option, so you will be able to open only Steam and needed software to make it run correctly. It's almost a Steam Desktop Environment.
